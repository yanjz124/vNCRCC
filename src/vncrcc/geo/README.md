Drop FAA SFRA/FRZ/P56 files here.

Supported formats:
- GeoJSON (.geojson, .json) — preferred
- (XML/KML support may be added later)

Files will be loaded by `vncrcc.geo.loader` by filename; name files with meaningful stems such as `SFRA.geojson`, `FRZ.geojson`, or `P56.geojson` so the API can discover them.
